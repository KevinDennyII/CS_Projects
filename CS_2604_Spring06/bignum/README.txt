PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE TESTING!

I am using my own test file and made the test according to the specs.  
Each operand is seperated by a space and two new lines terminate an expression. I 
felt that file that professor North has given us was too messy to attempt to interrupt 
and would further obscure the fact that I have knowledge about the data structures we are 
having to implement for this first project.

I also had trouble doing my exponential.  In using iterators with my Doubly Linked List,
the iterators made it difficult to do.  If I had a choice, by allowing my parament for the 
exponential function to be exponList(list, int), the method does in fact work in which i have test tested.
All other operation work completely (ofcourse includeing addition and multiplication) using
stacks and lists.
